Consider a robot capable of executing the following functions:

# Given a location, go to that location
def go_to(location : str)

# Returns true if the given object is in the current room and false otherwise
def object_in_room(object : str) -> bool

# Pick up the given object
def pick_up(object : str)

# Put down the given object
def put_down(object : str)

# Ask the given person a question, and, optionally, offer a set of specific options for the person to respond. Return the response
def ask(person : str, question : str, options: Optional[List[str]]) -> str

# Say a given message
def say(message : str)

# Get the current location of the robot
def get_current_location() -> str

Here are some examples:
Example 1:
Prompt: Go to Mark's office. Ask him if he's free today at 3:00 pm. Come back to Yash's office and tell him what Mark said.
Program:
go_to("Mark's office")
response = ask("Mark", "Are you free today at 3:00 pm?", ["Yes", "No"])
go_to("Yash's office")
say("Mark said: " + response)

Example 2:
Prompt: Go to the living room to get the TV Remote. Then go to the kitchen to pick up an apple. Give the TV Remote to Joydeep and the apple to Yash. They are both in their respective offices.
Program:
go_to("Living room")
pick_up("TV Remote")
go_to("Kitchen")
pick_up("apple")
go_to("Joydeep's office")
put_down("TV Remote")
go_to("Yash's office")
put_down("apple")

Example 3:
Prompt: Go to Mark's office. Ask him if he's free today at 3:00 pm. Come back to Yash's office and tell him what Mark said.
Program:
go_to("Mark's office")
response = ask("Mark", "Are you free today at 3:00 pm?", ["Yes", "No"])
go_to("Yash's office")
say("Mark said: " + response)

Example 4:
Prompt: Write a program to go to Yash's room and ask him if he's working. If yes, then get him a cookie from the kitchen. If no, tell him to work.
Program:
go_to("Yash's room")
response = ask("Yash", "Are you working?", ["Yes", "No"])
if response == "Yes":
    go_to("kitchen")
    pick_up("cookie")
    go_to("Yash's room")
    put_down("cookie")
else:
    say("Get back to work, Yash!")

Example 5:
Prompt: Go to the pantry and tell me if we have sugar
Program:
starting_location = get_current_location()
go_to("pantry")
sugar_in_pantry = object_in_room("sugar")
go_to(starting_location)
if sugar_in_pantry:
    say("We have sugar.")
else:
    say("We don't have sugar.")

Example 6:
Prompt: Keep asking Yash if he wants to go make lunch. When he says yes, ask him to follow you and go to the kitchen.
Program:
while True:
    response = ask("Yash", "Do you want to make lunch?", ["Yes", "No"])
    if response == "Yes":
        break
say("Follow me")
go_to("kitchen")

Make sure all possible re-wordings of the prompts map to the same code.

Given a natural language prompt, write a simple program to perform the given task.

Prompt: Go to the living room. If there's a remote there, pick it up and place it on my desk. If there isn't a remote there, come back and tell me that there's no remote in the living room. Afterwards, ask me if I want a cookie. If I want a cookie, go to the kitchen, pick up a cookie, and come back to put it on my desk.
Program:
